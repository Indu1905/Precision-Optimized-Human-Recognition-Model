**Precision-Optimized Human Recognition Model for Adaptive** 

**Information Retrieval in Education Institutions— Built using** 

**Python, OpenCV, dlib, and Streamlit** 

This model uses HOG + SVM for face detection and a ResNet-based deep metric learning model for accurate face recognition. Integrated with SQLite and a Streamlit dashboard, it enables real-time identification and retrieval of student data. Designed for educational institutions, the system enhances security, streamlines student management, and ensures high precision.
